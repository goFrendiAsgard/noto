# Noto

A personal todo list based on Zrb and todo.txt



# Prerequisites

To start working with Noto, you need to have:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Pip
- Venv

You can also use [Zrb Docker container](https://github.com/state-alchemists/zrb#-with-docker) if you prefer to work with Docker.

# Getting started

To get started, you need to activate Noto virtual environment and install a few packages (including Zrb). You can do this by invoking the following command in your terminal:

```bash
source ./project.sh
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, you will be able to invoke any Zrb commands.

To make sure that Zrb is accessible, you can try to invoke the following commands:

```bash
zrb version
```
